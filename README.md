# Castle Baloneybeard
**Castle Baloneybeard is an amazingly simple puzzle game!**
You are playing as the castle owner Baloneybeard in search of lost baloney, which you somehow misplaced.

Navigate through unavoidable puzzles as you scratch your head trying to figure out what to do, and more importantly: Making the ultimate sandwich!


Updated April 2020: **Source updated to be compatible with Godot Engine 3!**
Updated May 2021: **Still works!**
